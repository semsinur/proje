# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit
# numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

i = 999
while (i > 100):
    i -= 1

            if (s == s[::-1]):
                num = i * j
